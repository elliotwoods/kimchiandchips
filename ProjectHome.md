This code is generated through development of our internal research and client projects. Please reference the use of Kimchi and Chips' code if you use it in your projects.

Code is released under MIT license with this additional condition:


By opening, viewing, distributing, receiving or otherwise utilising code enclosed herein, you accept the following condition:

That any commercial projects (that is, projects, software, installations, performances, research, any other commercial uses) which employ the techniques or code  which have been made available at code.kimchiandchips.com and sites managed by kimchi and chips, will bear fair reference to the use of Kimchi and Chips resources in the documentation of their commercial projects.

Whereby 'Fair reference' is defined as:
1. Including 'Kimchi and Chips' in any published credits of the project (i.e. video documentation, programmes, promotional materials, etc)
2. Linking to Kimchi and Chips website (www.kimchiandchips.com) on any pages which host video or photos of the project the project.

An example of this would be:
If you use our projection mapping software/techniques for a commercial mapping project, you would:
a) Include the text 'projection technique by Kimchi and Chips' in the video
b) Include the text 'projection technique by Kimchi and Chips' on a youtube/vimeo/other page which hosts a video of the final result of the project, with a link to "http://www.kimchiandchips.com"

No reference is required for non-commercial projects. But it's always nice! :)

....also i think i need to get round to seriously addressing licensing issues at some point. I think this is probably too strict for a lot of work that'll end up on this svn
